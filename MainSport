/*Design and implement a set of classes that keeps track of sports statistics.
Have each low-level class represent a specific sport(basketball,
soccer, tennis or your choice). Tailor the services of the classes
to the sport in question and move common attributes to the higher-level classes.
Create a main driver class to instantiate several of the classes.

Attributes to consider: score, equipment, teams, rules or anything else that comes to mind.
