//Design and implement a set of classes that define types of reading material
//        (i.e. novels, magazines, technical journals, etc.).
//        Include data values that describe the material, such as the number of pages, author,
//        publisher, etc.  Consider using a parent (abstract) class to simplify your design.
//        In each concrete class, include appropriate methods including a toString that will
//        print an appropriate message.
//        Create a main driver class to instantiate several of the classes.
//        Create an array of the works and output it.
