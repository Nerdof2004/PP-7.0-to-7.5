//Design and implement a class called MonetaryCoin that is derived from the class Coin.
//        Store a value in the monetary coin that represents its value (how much the coin is worth)
//        and add a method that returns its value.  Create a main driver class to instantiate and
//        compute the sum of several MonetaryCoin objects.  Show that a monetary coin inherits its
//        parentâ€™s ability to be flipped.
