/*Design and implement a class called MonetaryCoin that
is derived from the class Coin.  Store a value in the
monetary coin that represents its value (how much the coin
is worth) and add a method that returns its value.
Create a main driver class to instantiate and compute the sum
of several MonetaryCoin objects.  Show that a monetary coin inherits
its parentâ€™s ability to be flipped.
